# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

This project demonstrates infrastructure automation using Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources on AWS. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure as code, allowing for consistent and repeatable provisioning of resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version X.X.X or later)
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Manu-Abuya/terraform-aws-infrastructure.git

2. Change into the project directory:
    ```shell
    cd terraform-aws-infrastructure
    
3. Initialize the Terraform project:
   ```shell
   terraform init
4. Customize the variables:
   - Open variables.tf file and modify the values according to your requirements.
   - Alternatively, create a terraform.tfvars file and set the variable values there.

5. Deploy the infrastructure:
   ```shell
   terraform apply

### Usage

   - Modify the main.tf file to define your desired infrastructure resources (e.g., VPCs, EC2 instances, security groups).
   - Use variables defined in variables.tf to customize the configuration.
   - Run terraform plan to see a preview of the changes that Terraform will make.
   - Run terraform apply to provision the resources on AWS.
   - Remember to destroy the resources when no longer needed: terraform destroy
